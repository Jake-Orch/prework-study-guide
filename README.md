# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I wrote this project so that i could learn the foundation blocks of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and GitHub. This is the first step im my journey of learning web development. In this project I created a study guide webpage to put all the useful information i learned while completing the prework on the website so that I may look back on it someday and see how far ive come.

## Usage

You can read all of the information on this study guide to get some small information on JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Github. and use this as a base to grow your information on all of these subjects. If you're stuggling on deciding what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by right clicking the webpage then selecting inspect. A control panel should open where you will see all the subjects listed and a randomly generated suggestion on which subject to study first!
